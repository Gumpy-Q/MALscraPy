# MALscraPy
Want to scrap MAL for specific seasons ? Here it is

## A NoobxWeaboo attempt to scrap anime's data from MyAnimeList

Access to last data here https://www.kaggle.com/crazygump/myanimelist-scrappind-a-decade-of-anime

## Wanna run the script without knowing much about Python ?
### Requisite
You only need to install [Python]( https://www.python.org/downloads/) and its following modules:
* [Requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/install/#install) 
* [BeautifulSoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-beautiful-soup)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/install/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html)

### Run it
When you will run the script, follow the instruction in the command prompt.
Beware: scraping large temporal range might be a bit RAM intensive (800 MB for 2021 to 2010)

This is may not be the fastest way to scrap MAL (30s to scrap all 2020 anime content with 15 seconds of sleep time to avoid making MAL mad at me)
